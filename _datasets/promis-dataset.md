notes: 'Calibration data for the majority of PROMIS item banks and short forms. From July 2006 to March 2007, data were collected from the U.S. general population and multiple disease populations. The sampling plan was developed for collecting responses to the candidate items from the targeted PROMIS domains and was designed to accommodate multiple objectives 1) create item calibrations for each domain; 2) estimate profile scores for various disease populations; 3) create linking metrics to legacy questionnaires (e.g., SFâ€“36); 4) confirm the factor structure of the domains; and 5) conduct item and bank analyses. Because of the large total number of items (> 1000), it was not possible for participants to respond to the entire pool. Based on an estimate of 4 questions per minute, the number of items administered to any respondent was limited to about 150 (37 minutes). (2010)'
