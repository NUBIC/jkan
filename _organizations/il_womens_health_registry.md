title: Illinois Women's Health Registry at Northwestern University
description: The Women's Health Research Institute created the Illinois Women's Health Registry in order to address the underrepresentation of women in scientific and clinical research studies.  For women who join the Registry, we offer you the opportunity to participate in important research impacting women's health.  For investigators, we facilitate the recruitment of women for approved studies. Follow the links above for more information.
